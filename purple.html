					<p><b>Hi Admin!</b></p>

						<p>Thank you to everyone who attended this workshop series about <b>"Anger, Fear, Triggers & Surrender."</b> This workshop experience has been tremendously enjoyable for me, and I hope it has been enjoyable and helpful for you as well. All of the recordings will continue to be available for you to share with family and friends or to watch again as many times as you'd like. Within the next few days, we'll be organizing all the workshop recordings and making them available as "courses." Stay tuned -- more information about that coming soon.</p>
